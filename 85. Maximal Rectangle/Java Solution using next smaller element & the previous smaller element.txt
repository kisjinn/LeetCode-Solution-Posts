Concept/Solution of 84.Largest rectangle in histogram is applicable in this problem

Approach
1.In histogram, we find the next smaller element and the previous smaller element,using which we find the maximum rectangle in histogram
2.First of all we make an array of size equal to column size pass each one dimensional array to largestRectangleArea() function
-we add matri[i][j] to current_row[j] if 1 else make current_row[j] = 0.
3.Thus for each row we calculate the largest rectangle and return maximum of all calculated rectangle.
