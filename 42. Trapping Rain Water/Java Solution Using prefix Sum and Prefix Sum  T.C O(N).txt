# Approach
1.For each building find prev maximum height bar to it using prefix sum
2.for each bar, find next maximum height bar to it using suffix sum
3.for height[i] bar, Water trapped by height[i] bar= Math.min(prefix[i], suffix[i]) - height[i]
4.calculate water trapped by each building and return it

# Complexity
- Time complexity:O(N)

- Space complexity:O(N)
