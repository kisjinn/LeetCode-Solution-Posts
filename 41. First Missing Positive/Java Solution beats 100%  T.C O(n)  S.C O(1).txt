Intuition
PLace the element at its corerct position in first part. In second part, iterate through an array and element which is not at correct position, return that element.

Approach
We will breakdown solution in 2 parts
a) PLace the elements at its correct index e.g 1 should be present at 0th index, 2 at 1st index.......................
b) After above opeartions, element will be at correct position
Now, iterate through array and check element which is not at its correct position and return it.

Complexity
Time complexity:O(n)

Space complexity:O(1)
