# Intuition
(nsr=Nearest Smallest right element index, nsl=Nearest Smallest Left element index)
for a bar height[i], maximum area that can form within height[i] will lie between nsr and nsl
so length=height[i]
   width=distance between nsr and nsl - 1


# Approach
1.Find nearest left smallest element index for each heights[i] 
2.Find nearest right smallest element index for each heights[i] 
3.length=heights[i]
  breadth=nsr-nsl-1
  area=length*breadth

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(N)

- Space complexity:O(N)
