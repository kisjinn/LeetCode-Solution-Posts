Intuition
Separate out nodes with values < x into one Linked List and nodes with value > x into second Linked List. After that, connect two linked List

Approach
1.Take two Linked List, one list will contain all nodes having value < x and second Linked List will contain all nodes having value >= x
2.After separating out nodes into two linkked List, connect Linked list1 to Linked list2
